    Once in Times, it was well inhabited. But by now, only folks which are too weak or
    refuse to leave remain on this planet.
  </p>
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>Namek is not an interesting Planet, which most of the folks soon realized. The Races are weak, the
    monsters too little and rest was too tidy. The Dragons were the first to leave, since then many Humans, Elves and
    other Races followed them. They all shared a secret together, the secret of world traveling. The unknown Power
    allowed them to leave Namek. Yet, those who left without a trace, left nothing for theirs and their knowlegde was
    forgotten.</p>

  <p>Soon a balance was made again. Those which had no intention to leave Namek, stayed and build a new System. And
    so the secret of world traveling was almost completely forgotten. By now, the <i>old world Namek</i> was forgotten
    and a new Era began.</p>

  <p>The new Era began with <i>new laws</i>. The most famous Rule in <b>Mordenia</b> was <b>NO LAWS</b>. In this Land
    was everything allowed and anything possible.
  </p>

  <p><b>Nirvana</b> is the Land with the lowest population, next to <i>Travenia</i>. The word family "Kind" is not in
    the vocabulary of Nirvana's people.</p>

  <p><b>Llaveniss</b> is the biggest Land on Namek. With the new Era, <i>Llaveniss</i> became a <b>tournament
      Island</b>. Llaveniss is a Land, where the strongest of Namek gather and fight for the <b>Peak of the
      World</b>.
  </p>

  <p>The <b>Sea of Death</b> became its name due to the terrible Monsters who hide beneath this wicked waters. These
    Monsters wait for their prey,
    destroying even the biggest ships and kill even the strongest Warriors.</p>

  <p><b>Travenia</b> is truly a boring Island in comparison to the others. The weakest of all gather here, with hopes
    to get stronger and succeed in their goals.</p>
