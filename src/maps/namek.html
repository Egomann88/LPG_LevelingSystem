  <p id="titleText">
    Once in Times, it was well inhabited. But by now, only folks which are too weak or
    refuse to leave remain on this planet.
  </p>
  <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
  <p id="storyText">Namek is not an intressting Planet, which most of the volks soon realised. The Races are weak, the
    monsters too little and rest was to tidy. The Dragons were the first to leave, since then many Humans, Elfes and
    other Races followed them. They all shared a secret together, the secret of worldtraveling. The unknown Power
    allowed them to leave Namek. Yet, thoose who left without a trace, left nothing for theirs.</p>

  <p>Soon a balance was made again. Thoose which had no intention to leave Namek, stayed and builed an new System. And
    so the secret of worldtraveling was almost completely forgotten. By now, the <i>old world Namek</i> was forgotten
    and a new Era began.</p>

  <p>The new Era began with <i>new laws</i>. The most famous Rule in <b>Mordenia</b> was <b>NO LAWS</b>. In this Land
    was everything allowed and anything possible. These Monsters wait for their prey,
    destroing even the biggest ships and kill even the stronges Warriors.
  </p>

  <p><b>Nirvana</b> is the Land with the lowest population next to <i>Travenia</i>. The wordfamily "Kind" is not in
    the
    vocabulary of Nirvana's people.</p>

  <p><b>Llaveniss</b> is the biggest Land on Namek. With the new Era, <i>Llaveniss</i> became a <b>tounament
      Island</b>.
    Llaveniss is a Land, where all of the strongest Races of Namek gather and fight for the <b>Peak of the World</b>.
  </p>

  <p>The <b>Sea of Death</b> became its name due to the terrible Monsters who hide beneath this wicked waters.</p>

  <p><b>Travenia</b> is truly a boring Island in comparison to the others. The weakes of all gather here, with hopes
    to
    get stronger and succed in their goals.</p>
