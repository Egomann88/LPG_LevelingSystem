    Once in Times, it was well inhabited. But by now, only folks which are too weak or
    refuse to leave remain on this planet.

  <h2>Story</h2>
  <!-- first history -->
  <h3>First History - The forgotten Era</h3>

  <p>Namek is not an interesting Planet, which most of the folks soon realized. The Races are weak, the
    monsters too little and rest was too tidy. The Dragons were the first to leave, since then many Humans, Elves and
    other Races followed them. They all shared a secret together, the secret of world traveling. The unknown Power
    allowed them to leave Namek. Yet, those who left without a trace, left nothing for theirs and their knowlegde was
    forgotten.</p>

  <p>The people were scared, all strong warriors and sages disappeared. The balance and order was collapsing. Namek
    would never be the same again. Many Monsters came and raided the lands and killed the defenseless. Before a complete
    disaster, a handful of people gathered together to bring new Order: one Nymph, an Elf, a Dragonborn and one Human.
    Those four Legends were Nameks last hope and the Pillars for the new Era</p>

  <!-- New Order -->
  <h3>New Order</h3>

  <p>Those four Legends combined their strength to defeat the Monsters and saved Namek Citizens from extinction. The
    Monsters withdrew to a place, which is today known as the Sea of Death. Yet they were not friends, they just had the
    same goal. So they fought. The strongest of them should get the biggest Island, while the weakest got the smallest
    one.</p>

  <!-- Ancient Legends -->
  <h3>Ancient Legends</h3>

  <h4>The Elf</h4>
  <p>The ancient Elf was the weakest of the ancient Legends. At least this is believed so. They did not wanted to fight
    against any of the others. He gladly claimed the smallest Island and followed his goal. His was that the past events
    should not repeat themselves.</p>

  <h4>The Human</h4>
  <p>The ancient Human was Rouge, which walked in the dark and struck in the light. He wasn't really popular and not
    very kind. His goal was to create a harbor, in which even smugglers, thief and other criminals could feel safe and
    have freedom from strict laws.</p>

  <h4>The Nymph</h4>
  <p>The Nymph fought merciless, but was unable to defeat the great <i>Dragonborn</i>. It is not known if the Nymph
    planned all along, to separate herself from the other, or if this was because of frustration. Yet she used her
    water magic to distance her Island from the others. While the other more or less still sustained contact, the Nymph
    cut all threads with her former companions. It was narrated that, She was the meanest of them all and that she
    was racist towards landcreatures.</p>

  <h4>The Dragonborn</h4>
  <p>The ancient Dragonborn lived for the heat of the battle. He always improved his skills with fighting. But even he,
    the strongest man alive, wasn't able to defeat the tough of time. In order to remain his legacy, he created an
    tournament Island. The winner of this tournament should be the new lord of this Island and (theoretically) the King
    of the entire world.</p>
  <p>Even today, the Power of the Dragonborn is unmatched.</p>

  <!-- Erasesment of the past -->
  <h3>Erasesment of the past</h3>
  <p>This was done by the Elf alone, but others weren't trying to stop him, so it is assumed that they all shared the
    same opinion.</p>
  <p>The Elf gathered all the lore about <i>world traveling</i> and the <i>old Namek</i> and destroyed it in order to
    protect the new generation of Namek. Today, less than a handful of Books of the <i>old Namek</i> remain. Yet the
    secret of <i>world traveling</i> was erased completel</p>

  <!-- New Era -->
  <h3>New Era - The golden Era</h3>
  <p>Soon a balance was made again. Those which had no intention to leave Namek, stayed and build a new System. And
    so the secret of world traveling was almost completely forgotten. By now, the <i>old world Namek</i> was forgotten
    and a new Era began.</p>

  <!-- Systems of the Islands -->
  <h3>Systems of the Islands</h3>
  <p>The new Era began with <i>new laws</i>. The most famous Rule in <b>Mordenia</b> was <b>NO LAWS</b>. In this Land
    was everything allowed and anything possible. Mordenia was the Island of the ancient Human.
  </p>

  <p><b>Nirvana</b> is the Land with the lowest population, next to <i>Travenia</i>. The word family "Kind" is not in
    the vocabulary of Nirvana's people. Nirvana bad habits came from ancient Nymph.</p>

  <p><b>Llaveniss</b> is the biggest Land on Namek. With the new Era, <i>Llaveniss</i> became a <b>tournament
      Island</b>. Llaveniss is a Land, where the strongest of Namek gather and fight for the <b>Peak of the
      World</b>, just like the ancient Dragonborn wanted.
  </p>

  <p><b>Travenia</b> is truly a boring Island in comparison to the others. The weakest of all gather here, with hopes
    to get stronger and succeed in their goals. The Elf setted on this Island. His invention was to create the roots of
    this world. Making Travenias people stronger, was a hedge that the events of the past should never be repeated.</p>

  <p>The <b>Sea of Death</b> became its name due to the terrible Monsters who hide beneath this wicked waters. These
    Monsters wait for their prey,
    destroying even the biggest ships and kill even the strongest Warriors.</p>

      <h3>Dragons</h3>
      <p>The Story and disappears of the Dragons leaves many open questions. The gigantic winged
        lizards are known as
        the Dragons. The majestic Beasts left this world a very long time ago.
        It was a mystery, why the elder Dragons left Namek so sudden. They may thought the same as the other, that Namek
        was boring and weak. Yet, was this reason enough to disappear and leaving all their descendants back. Their
        Children's Eggs hatched and grew without their parents. What happened with the dragonslings, is known. Probably
        they all have died off, lack of protection and love.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="race">
      <h3>Humans</h3>
      <p>"I am a Human" is a Quote which triggers often disgust at others. The remaining Humas are mostly outlaws and
        criminals. Of course, <b>if</b> the Humans still exist...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="raceContainer">
    <div class="race">
      <h3>Landcreatures</h3>
      <p>The landcreatures of Namek are all spread across Namek. Their roots go far beyond the chronicles of Namek.
        Indeed, they almost extinct if the old legends not have been.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="race">
      <h3>Nightcreatures</h3>
      <p>They are feared and hated by the most. As a
        result of this, their Kind is on the verge of extinction. The last Hotspot is the moon Village, in the west
        of Travenia. On these plains live the so-called Childs of Night. The planes are not often visited and well
        protected. However, if this Hotspot falls, the end of the Nightcreatures shall follow soon.</p>

  <div class="raceContainer">
    <div class="race">
      <h3>Watercreatures</h3>
      <p>Most of the Watercreatures live on Nirvana and these are not very friendly to other races. Their roots go far
        beyond the chronicles of Namek.
        Indeed, they almost extinct if the old legends not have been.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="race">
      <h3>Demons</h3>
      <p>The Demon race is the most mysterious and evil race. They have
        neither loyalty nor any moral. They steal and kill
        from all, including themselves. Through the self-destructive behavior of the Demons, there would not have lasted
        long. Out of nowhere came the <i>Demonking</i>. The new king of the Demons, had the endless demands to claim the
        Lands of Namek. In Order to do so, he seeks people and artifacts with power.</p>
